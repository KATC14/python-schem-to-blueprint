# python-schem-to-blueprint

# be warned
this works BUT is a proof of concept, it has a lot of bugs and is no longer being worked on<br>
this only works on [Sponge Schematic(.schem)](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Schematic-Specification) file format that [Amulet-Map-Editor](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Map-Editor) can export/import

## dependencies
This requires [Amulet-NBT](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-NBT) from [Amulet-Core](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Core) its probably just best to install the Amulet-Core because it will install most of the dependencies this needs other than python [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)<br><br>
This requires [python numpy](https://numpy.org/)
